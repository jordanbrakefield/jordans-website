Hi, I’m Jordan Brakefield — a recent B.S. Software Engineering graduate with nearly a decade of experience at Boeing in manufacturing and supply chain operations. While working full-time, I earned my degree from Western Governors University, blending real-world problem-solving skills with a strong technical foundation.

My portfolio includes projects ranging from Android apps and full-stack web applications to smart home integrations in my personal home lab — including building a home networking rack from the ground up. I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and a passion for bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

Whether I’m writing clean, scalable code, deploying a cloud service, or streamlining a workflow, my goal is the same: deliver practical, high-quality solutions that just work.
